      <description>So recently Neovim 0.5 version was released with in built LSP(Language Server Protocol) and Lua language support. So I modifed my init.vim with &amp;lsquo;coc-nvim&amp;rsquo; to init.lua and the in built LSP.I want to save both the config files in GitHub.I googled and found that people have dot files repository where they store all the configuration files.So I decided to follow the same approach.I used the git orphan branches to store different configuration files.</description>

      <description>Folding in vim I have started using NeoVim as my editor.So I have added lot of configurations in my init.vim file.I keep updating the same when I find some new requirements. So I wanted to manage all the configurations related to NeoVim and its Plugins. I checked various ways and found that folding was one of the methods to do that.Folding is a way of collapsing a group of lines into a single line.</description>

      <description>I recently started using Neovim as my text editor.Also right now I am learning Flutter to create a mobile application for my personal project. So I decided to setup Neovim as a Flutter IDE.With this I can practice Vim with Flutter.
Install Plugins To setup Neovim as Flutter IDE we need to use coc.nvim plugin .Also for formatting, I am using the dart_vim_plugin.We also need the snippets to be loaded like the ones for stateless/stateful widget.</description>
