      <description>So recently Neovim 0.5 version was released with in built LSP(Language Server Protocol) and Lua language support. So I modifed my init.vim with &amp;lsquo;coc-nvim&amp;rsquo; to init.lua and the in built LSP.I want to save both the config files in GitHub.I googled and found that people have dot files repository where they store all the configuration files.So I decided to follow the same approach.I used the git orphan branches to store different configuration files.</description>

      <description>Folding in vim I have started using NeoVim as my editor.So I have added lot of configurations in my init.vim file.I keep updating the same when I find some new requirements. So I wanted to manage all the configurations related to NeoVim and its Plugins. I checked various ways and found that folding was one of the methods to do that.Folding is a way of collapsing a group of lines into a single line.</description>
