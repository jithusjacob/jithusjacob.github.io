      <description>I have started using NeoVim as my editor.So I have added lot of configurations in my init.vim file.I keep updating the same when I find some new requirements. So I wanted to manage all the configurations related to NeoVim and its Plugins. I checked various ways and found that folding was one of the methods to do that.Folding is a way of collapsing a group of lines into a single line.</description>
